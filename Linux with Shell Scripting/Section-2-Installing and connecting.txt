 Section-2-Installing and connecting to a Linux sysem
*Linux is an Operating system
*Linux OS = Linux Distribution(Debian,ubunt,redhat)
*Distro/Flavor =Distribution
*The kernel is the core
 its sits btw the hardware and application like a interface.
*Linux Kernal + Apps = Distro
*Two most popular Linux distros: Redhat and ubuntu
*RHEL: Redhat Enetrprise Linux
*Almalinux, Rocky Linux are free redhat Linux deravatives 
*Redhat :banks, Airlines, Telecom, Healthcare, Government
*Ubuntu: startups, SaaS, Social Networks, Cloud Based
*some other Linux versions:
 Linux Mint, Manjaro, Pop!_os, fedora, Debian, openSUSE, Arch Linux, Slackware
___________________________ __________________________
*WSL= Windows Subsystem for Linux
*Alternative to creating Virtual Machines
*Multiple Linux Distributions are available.
*lightweight (Less resource usage than a VM)
*Windows 10 or newer
*virtualization setting Enabled in Bios.
*Internet Connection
->Installing Linux on windows using WSL
*wsl --install
*restart and start ubuntu commandline interface
*Set username and pass
*you can change font, layout, color by righ clicking on ubuntu terminal bar
*wsl -l -o (to get list of distro that are available online)
*wsl --install -d Debian (just like this write any disto name)
*wsl -l ( to list the distro that are available offline)
->Access Linux Files and Directories from the file explorer
*click on file explorer and there you will find below a Linux logo
*there you can access all the files of the distros that are available 
->Remove Linux Distributions from WSL
*wsl --unregister Debian
*now the files have been removed and you just need to remove the application.
->OVA :Open Virtual Appliance File
*It is preconfigerd Virtual Machine, packaged in a single file and ready to be imported. (like: linuxtrainingacademy.com/ova) 
*now extract the file(7-zip)
*then insert it into virtual box

->Antivirus conflicts:
*Error in supr3hardenedWinreSpawn
*VERR_OPEN_FAILED
*E_FAIL(0x80004005)
*NTCreateFile(\Device\VBoxDrvStub)failed.
*for this disable you antivirus soft or switch to another antivirus soft
->This kernel requires x86-64 CPU,but only detected an i686 CPU
*for this you need to enable the virtualization and vtx for intel and amd-v for amd processor from the bios.

->This kernel requires x86-64 CPU,but only detected an i686 CPU
  this processor is unsupported in centos 7
* the reason behind it may be you have selected wrong virtual processor(try checking version with 64-bit)

-> last is rebooting your system
