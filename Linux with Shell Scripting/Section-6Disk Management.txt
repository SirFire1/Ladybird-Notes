Section-6:Disk Management
->Partitions:
 *Disk can be divided into parts, called partitions.
 *Partitions allow you to separate data
 *partitions schemes
  1)OS 2)Application 3)User 4)Swap
  1)OS,2)User home directories
  As a system administrator, you decide
 *Can protect the overall system
 *Keep users from creating outages by using a home directory partition
 E.G: 
     $ df -h      (disk space usage in human readable format)
      Filesystem   Size  Used  Avail  Use%  Mounted on
       /dev/sda2   100G  75G   25G     75%     /
       /dev/sda1   488M  111M  342M    25%     /boot
       /dev/sda3   10G    10G   0      100%    /home
->MBR: Master Boot Record
  *Can only address 2TB of disk space
  *Being phased out by GPT
  *4Primry Partitions
  *Extented partitions allow you to create logical partitions
   
->GPT: GUID Partition Table
 *GUID: Global Unique Indentifier
 *Replacing the MBR partitioning scheme 
 *Part of UEFI
 *UEFI: Unified extensible firmware interface
 *UEFI is replacing BIOS
 *There are no primary and extended partition with GPT
 *Supports up to 128 partitions
 *Supports up to 9.4ZB disk sizes
 *Not supported by older operating system
 *May require newer or special tools
->Mount points:
 * A directory used to access the data on a partition 
 * /(slash) is always a mount point 
 * /home
     /home/Jason is on the partition mounted on /home
 * /export/home
    /export/home/Jason
->Mounting over existing directory
  mkdir /home/sarah
  mount /dev/sdb2 /home
 *You will not be able to see /home/sarah now.
 
  umount /home
 *You can now see /home/sarah again
 *Mount should be done before creating sub directory.
-> fdisk
 *Alternatives: gdisk, parted
 *Earlier version of fdisk did not support GPT
  fdisk /path/to/device
_____________________________ __________________________________
 *fdisk -l | less  (to display list of devices)
 *fdisk /dev/sda    (you will enter into this partition)
 * n  : will create a new MBR partition, g: for GPT
 *It will ask some questions about the partitions:
   p primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e extended
 * p : after taking the primary p partition
 *partition default number (1-4, default 1):  Just press enter if its your first partition
 *first sector (2048-104857599, default 2048): press enter for default
 *last sector,{KMG} for size: +1G (leaving it  empty will assign full space)
 *And the partition is created
 * t  :To change partition type 
 * l  :for list of partitions
 * n  :for new partition 
 * w  :to write this in disk
_____________________________________ _________________________________
->File Systems :It is required before any partition
 * ext= Extended file system
   ext2,ext3,and ext4 are later releases
 * Other file system
   ReiserFS
   JFS
   XFS
   ZFS
   Btrfs

->mkfs : To create a file system
  mkfs -t TYPE DEVICE
  mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb2
  mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sbd3
         or
  mkfs.ext4  /dev/sdb3
 
 *man mkfs.xfs   : for xfs manual

->Mounting with mount:
  mount DEVICE MOUNT_POINT
  mount /dev/sdb3 /opt
->Manual mounts do not persist(hold firmly)
  In order to make mounts persist between reboots, add an entry in the /etc/fstab file
->Unmount with the unmount command
  umount Device_OR_MOUNT_POINT
  
  umount  /opt
  umount  /de/sdb3
___________________________________ __________________________
->Preparing swap space
->Instead of creating filesystem and mounting it, use swap space
  mkswap /path/to/partition/
 #mkswap /dev/sdb1
 #swapon /dev/sdb1  :to enable the swap partition
 #swapon -s         :to see swap device is in use
->/etc/fstab :The file System Table
 * Controls what device get mounted and where on boot
 * Each entry is made up of 6 fields
   device
   mount point
   file system type
   mount options
   dump
   fsck order        (file system check order)
*E.G:
 # device      mount   point   FS     options   dump     fsck
  /dev/sda2 /    /             xfs    default    0        1
  /dev/sda1     swap           swap   default    0        0
 *If dump has "1" it will backup the file system 
 *file system of value 1,will be checked first then for value 2
->Viewing Labels and UUIDs
 # lsblk -f
 # blkid
->labeling a file system: each file system have a labeling utility
 # e2label /dev/sdb3 opt   (for ext file system)
           (path)   (label)
