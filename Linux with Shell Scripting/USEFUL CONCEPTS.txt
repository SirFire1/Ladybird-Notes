->break: to stop the loop
#example of break
no=6
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
do
if [[ $no -eq $i ]]
then
echo "$no is found!!"
break
fi
echo "Number is $i"
done
->continue: to stop the current iteration of loop and start next iteration
#Suppose we only need to print odd number
for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
let r=$i%2                   # %2 is called modlus which gives 1 for even value and 0 for odd value
if [[ $r -eq 0 ]]
then
continue
fi
echo "odd no. is $i"
done

->>>>Result<<<<<<<<
odd no. is 1
odd no. is 3
odd no. is 5
odd no. is 7
odd no. is 9
-> sleep : To create delay b/w to executions ex: sleep 1s/1m
-> stop : To stop script at a point
E.G:
#!/bin/bash
#to  access the arguments
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]
then 
echo " Please provide an argument"
exit 1
echo "first argument is: $1"
echo "Second argument is: $2"

echo " All the arguments: $@"
echo " No of arguments are: $#"

-> exit status $? : gives you status of previous command if that was successful
-> echo $? : just write this command on terminal, if its gives 0 value then previous command was successful otherwise for 1 its unsuccessfull.
                          or
E.g:
#!/bin/bash
read -p "which site you want o check" site
ping -c l $site

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]
then
echo " successfully connected  to $site"
else 
echo " unable to connect to $site"
fi

...............................
basename : strip directory info and only give filename
e.g : basename /home/fire/file.txt ----> file.txt
dirname : strip the filename and give the directory path
e.g : basename /home/fire/file.txt ----> /home/fire
realname : gives you full path of a file
e.g : realpath test.csv-----> /home/fire/test.csv

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Check if file or dir exist <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
-> if [ -d folder_name ] : if folder exist
-> [ ! -d folder_name ] : If folder doesnt exist
-> if [ -f file_name ] : if file exists
-> if [ ! -f file_name ] : if file not exists
E.g :
#!/bin/bash
FILEPATH="/home/fire/file.txt"
if [[ -f $FILEPATH ]] 
then 
echo " File exists "
else
echo " file doesnt exists "
exit 1        Or               touch $FILEPATH
fi
