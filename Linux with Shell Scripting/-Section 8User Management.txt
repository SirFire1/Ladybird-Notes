->USER MANAGEMENT:
->How to manage users and groups
 *Accounts have a:
  Username(or login ID) 
  UID(user ID). This is a unique number
  Default groups       (each user belongs to a default group)
  Comments             (each comment for user)
  Shell                (a shell when user logs in)
  Home directory location
  #All this information is stored in /etc/passwd
   root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  #The format of the /etc/passwd:
   username:password:UID:GID:comments:home_dir:shell        (GID :Group ID)
  #Another example:
   joe;x:1000:1000:Joe Henderson:/home/joe:/bin/bash
->Custom for usernames <8 characters
 #if you use more then 8 then, it may provide error by providing UID inplace of username and viceversa
 #E.G: ps -fu joehenderson
       UID     PID    PPID  C   STIME   TTY    TIME     CMD
     joehend   1182   1181  0   22:48   pts/1 00:00:00  -bash
                         or
      $ ps -fu joehenderson
      UID     PID    PPID  C   STIME   TTY    TIME     CMD
     joehend   1182   1181  0   22:48   pts/1 00:00:00  -bash
 #less than 8 character in length by convention
 #Case sensitive
 #In all lowercase by convention
 #Number are allocated in username
 #Do not use special character
->password are stored in /etc/shadow
 #Encryoted password used to be stored in /etc/passwd
 #/etc/passwd is readable by everyone
 #Now encrypted password are stored in /etc/shadow
 #/etc/shadow is only readable by root
 #Prevents users trying to crack passwords.
->UIDs
 #The root account is always UID 0
 #UIDs are unique numbers.
 #System accounts have UIDs<1000
  *configured in /etc/login.defs
->GID
 #The GID listed in the /etc/passwd for is the default group for an account.
 #New files belong to a user's default group.
 #Users can switch groups by using the "newgrp" command.
->Comment Field
 #Typically contains the user's full name.
 #In the case of a system or application account, it often contains what the account is used for.
 #May contains additional information like a phone number
 #Also called the GECOS field.
->Home directory:
 #Upon login the user is placed in their home directory listed in the passwd file.
 #If the directory doesn't exist, they are placed in "/" 
->Shell
 #the shell will be executed when a user logs in
 #A list of available shells are in /etc/shells
 #The shell doesn't have to be a shell
 #To prevent interactive use of an account, use /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false as the shell.
 #shells can be command line applications.

                           |     |  |    | ||(days from the pass creation)                             
                           |     |  |    | |(days after pass has expired)
                           |     |  |    | (days that user want to expire)
                           |     |  |    (no of days after which pass must be changed) 
         (username)      (passwd)| (number of days before pass can be changed)
                                 (days since the pass was changed)
->useradd
   useradd[options]username
 -c "COMMENT"  comments for the account
 -m            creates the home directory
 -s/shell/path The path to the user's shell
  E.G: useradd -c "Grant Stewart" -m -s /bin/bash grant
                                                  (username)
->Create a password using passwd
  # passwd grant
  Enter new UNIX password:
  Retype new UNIX password:
  passwd :password updated successfully
 #Account information for "grant"
 # tail -1 /etc/passwd
  grant:x:1000:1000:Grant Stewart:/home/grant:/bin/bash
 # tail -1 /etc/shadow
  grant:$6$iDDsgsPYtR*c2Uc.:16507:0:99999:7:::
->More useradd options:
  -g GROUP           Specify the default group
  -G GROUP1,GROUPN   Additional groups
 #E.G: 
   # useradd -c "Edide Harris' -m -s /bin/bash -g slaes -G project eharris
 # passwd eharris
  Enter new UNIX password:
  Retype new UNIX password:
  passwd :password updated successfully
->System or Application accounts (these accounts are not meant to be used by person)
 # useradd -c "Apache Web Server User" -d /opt/apache -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin apache 
 # tail -1 /etc/passwd
   apache:x:999:999:Apache Web Server User:/opt/apache:/usr/sbin/nologin
 # "-r" is used to create system account
 # "-d/home/dir" to assign path of application or home directory
->/etc/skel
 #When using -m the home directory for the account is created
 #The contents of /etc/skel are copied into the home directory.
 #/etc/skel typically contains shell configuration files. (.profile,.bashrc,etc)
 #Which are not needed for application accounts in many instances.
->Use -u to specify the UID
 #Creating an account to be used by MYSQL
 # useradd -c "MySQL Server" -d /opt/MySQL -u 97 -s /usr/sbin/nologin mysql
 # tail -1 /etc/passwd
  mySQL:x:97;1003:MySQL Serevr: /opt/MySQL:/usr/sbin/nologin
 #Its a common practice to use the same UID for an account across multiple system.
 #This makes syncing data or sharing data easier to do, as Linux uses UID's to determine a file ownership.
->userdel[-r]username
 #ls /home
  eharris grant
 #userdel eharris              (to delete user account)
 #ls /home
  eharris grant
 #userdel -r grant             (to delete user directory)
 #ls /home
  eharris                      (only eharris dir is left)
->To update, or modify, an existing account
   usermod [options] username
 -c "COMMENTS"     Commnets account
 -g GROUP          Specify the default group
 -G GROUP1,GROUPN  Additional groups
 -s /shell/path    Path to the user's shell

 ->E.G:
   #grep MySQL /etc/passwd 
   mysql:x:97:1003:MySQL Server:/opt/MySQL:/usr/sbin/nologin
   #usermod -c "MySQL User" MySQL
   #grep mysql /etc/passwd
    mysql:x:97:1003:MySQL Server:/opt/MySQL User:/usr/sbin/nologin
 ->The Group details are stored in /etc/group file
   root:x:0:
   sales:x:1001:john,mary         (for pass "/etc/gshadow" file)
   The format of the /etc/group file:
   group_name:password:GiD:account1,accountN
  #If an account GID is listed in default group in etc/passwd, it is listed in that account even if it is not in /etc/group.
 ->To display a group member belong to:
   groups[username]
  #groups root
   root
 ->groupadd[options]group_name
  #groupadd web
  #tail -1 /etc/group
   web:x;1003
  #groundadd -g 2500 db
  #tail -1 /etc/group
  db:x:2500:
  #groupdel group_name     (to delete a group)
  #groupmod [options] group_name       (to change properties of group)
   -g GID          change the group ID to GID
   -n GROUP        Rename the group to GROUP
  #E.G:
   #grep web /etc/group
    web:x:1003:
   #groupmod -g 1234 web
   #grep web /etc/group
    web:x:1234
   #groupmod -n http web
   #grep http /etc/group
    http:x:1234:
